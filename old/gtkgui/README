A gtk+ GUI for MuSE by nightolo <night@autistici.org>
***************

We are finally in beta part (coding, bug fixing, testing) of this
project.
The GUI now is integrated with MuSE and if you download a MuSE version
from CVS you'll find this GUI and this readme (I think :)

Compile it following README instruction in MuSE rootdir

Compatibility between C and C++ is broken, now GUI has got elements in
C++ (like calling of muse-core functions and bool type). 

In this dir I wrote a TODO  in which you can see future changes.
In this file you can see two part: the 0.7 one in which you'll find
bugfixes, features, coding of MuSE 0.7.* and the 0.8 one that you
could read if you are interested in future developing.

If you want to contribute in coding or testing or you want to suggest
some widget which you'd like to see in MuSE gtk+ GUI, feel free to
write me. Head README to see my mail ;)
