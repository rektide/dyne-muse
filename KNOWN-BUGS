BUG REPORTING is REALLY APPRECIATED! BUT TAKE CARE TO DO IT WELL:
please ALWAYS REPORT the muse --version you are running and possibly
run the binary with gdb giving us the backtrace of the error.

go to http://bugs.dyne.org and submit a BUG!!!

sometimes we are also on irc.freenode.net channel #dyne
